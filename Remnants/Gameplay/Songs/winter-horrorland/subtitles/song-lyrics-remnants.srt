1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,999
See the squiggling lines,

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,499
looks like you're out of time.

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,999
Can't stop relishing in your fright,

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,999
just wanna tear you out

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,199
AND EAT YOU ALIVE!!

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,199
Left in progress,

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,199
all construction meets an end,

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,750
voices calling for your rest.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,899
Broken to the end,

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,249
I'm just pieces in your head,

11
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,999
this nightmare you can never mend.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
(La, la, la, laaaa!)

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,999
Just imagine,

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,799
ripping flesh and guts apart.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,399
Your girlfriend screaming neath my arms

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,000
as I feast upon this nightly hour.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,849
Teeth rotting...

18
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,349
Skin peeling...

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,000
Your carcass is mine to take.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,749
Broiling marrow,

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,499
in your own peril.

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,249
Torture, agony!

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:02,999
More awaits!

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,749
Tremoring carols,

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,499
echoing bell tolls.

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
Tis your season to be blood-rained!

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,749
Ripping your nails,

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,499
tasting your blood,

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,999
your intestines come undone.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,649
Oh, what a thrill!

31
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,499
Such is this fill!

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,249
Flavours seeping

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,000
TO MY TONGUE!!

34
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,449
<font color="#FF0000">Your skin is freezing...

35
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,750
<font color="#FF0000">Here, let me help you take it off.

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,349
<font color="#FF0000">Your life is bleeding...

37
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,000
<font color="#FF0000">Underneath my afflicting claw.

38
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,199
<font color="#FF0000">Left in progress,

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,199
