1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,660
Do you ever wonder

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,790
what remains past this wireframe?

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,200
A realm of darkness inbetween...

4
00:00:10,740 ---> 00:00:15,700
(Oh ohh, ohhh, oooohhhhh...)

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,920
Sink your teeth into the flesh of thought.

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,620
What has brought us here?

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,450
Sketches brought to life back from the rot.

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,590
Don't you feel the fear?

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,340
We're forgotten.

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,580
We are remnants of what once was...

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,130
Oh, don't you think that feeling gives a

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,680
little buzz?

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,290
So

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,580
strap into your seats because it's

15
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,130
gonna be a wild ride!

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,670
Let's start by peeling off your skin,

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,380
see what's inside!

18
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,440
Trapped beneath that tasty layer of

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:16,950
FLESH,

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,440
lies the ink that was

21
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:18,690
left,

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,320
abandoned,

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,440
a work in progress

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,950
that never progressed.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,940
Now to you it may distress,

26
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,690
but to me,

27
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:24,940
oh!

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,190
I feel blessed!

29
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,440
to try a new food with such a

30
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,390
UNIQUE TASTE!

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,390
Like the

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,600
strawberry lines on your girl,

33
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,100
so fine!

34
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,240
Can you see what I mean?

35
00:01:34,54 --> 00:01:37,650
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaa!)

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,920
And the blueberry pasted

37
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,900
all over your face!

38
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,530
It was hard for me to decline

39
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,060
such an offer!

40
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,97
I feel seen...

41
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,020
Oh,

42
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,020
thank you so for

43
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,970
bringing back this

44
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,180
feast!

45
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,100
What...

46
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,190
a...

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,270
TREAT!!!

48
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,760
Do you ever wonder

49
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,170
about the great beyond?

50
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,770
Do you think it's a sign

51
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,710
from divines

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,600
that we've been brought back?

53
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,320
Or do you think we're the pawns?

54
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,630
I'll sink my teeth into your flesh

55
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,600
no matter the answer!

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,050
I may as well have my fun

57
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,100
if none of this matters!

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,260
You're forgotten,

59
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,450
don't forget that!

60
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,920
A remnant of the past

61
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,640
given last breaths.

62
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,530
Before the last death!

63
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,170
(Evil laughter)

64
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,480
So

65
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,100
strap yourself down to the table.

66
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,940
It's gonna be fatal

67
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,220
watching your insides pour

68
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,010
into a pool of ink

69
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,930
right beside your feet.

70
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,230
As I finally carve my way

71
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,890
INTO

72
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,400
YOUR

73
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,310
MEAT!!!
